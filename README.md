## Final Project - Analyzing Sales Data
This project demonstrates the use of Python and Pandas for analyzing sales data. The dataset used contains detailed sales transactions, and various analyses have been performed to extract insights on sales performance, profit trends, and state-wise statistics.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Filtering and aggregating sales data based on specific criteria (e.g., year, state, and region)
- Insights into top-performing segments, states with least sales, and profit analysis
- Visualizations showing sales statistics by state and time periods
- Proportion of total sales in specific regions (e.g., West and Central regions)
- Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib for data visualization

## Data Source:
Sales data stored in a CSV file containing columns like Order ID, Order Date, Product Category, Sales, Profit, and more.

## Analysis:
- Analysis of total and average sales over time.
- Profitability analysis for various segments in 2018.
- Region-wise and state-wise sales insights.
- Plotting of top states by average sales.

## Files:
- sample-store.csv: Sales transaction data
- df_California.csv: Filtered data for California
- df_2017_sales.csv: Sales data for the year 2017
